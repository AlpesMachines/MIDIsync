At least running on
- Arduino Duemilanove http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardDuemilanove
- Arduino Uno http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno (.hex binary provided, and platform of test)

Should be compatible with MIDI-Shield from Sparkfun (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9595).
Schematics and stuff are work in progress. Hang on :)
My devices running it (nicknamed "Hensel MODEL-01") have the following features:

- High-precision Master Clock
	- MIDI Clock Output
	- CV/Gate Output (0V/5V)
- Micro-adjustable Tempo (endless rotary knob, two speeds)
- Tap-Tempo Function (dropout protection, auto-smoothing)
- [Supports output of 1, 12, 24 and 48 clocks per quarter note]
- Control MIDI Equipment (start, continue, stop)
- ~~Split-Mode - Synchronize to external MIDI Clock~~
	- ~~Quickly toggle between both speeds (internal/external)~~
	- ~~[Control pass-through of control messages to MIDI-OUT]~~
- Settings can be saved in non-volatile memory
- Jumbo Tri-Color LEDs for Tempo and Status display
- MIDI-Thru (latency-free hardware circuit)
- ~~[MIDI-Forward (merge MIDI-In with generated clock signals to MIDI-Out)]~~
- Tolerant power input (7-12V DC) and hardware power switch
	- Low-power design, runs on batteries and USB-power (adapter required)
	- Energy-efficient power supply included

During development i decided to have some features not for the sake of stability. These are shown ~~strikethrough~~.

**Libraries are not included right now, going to add them as submodules.**
